# Leetspeak Translator

#### Epicodus Java Project to translate words into leetspeak, February 8, 2016

#### By Michelle Brecunier and Polina Nenchev

## Description

Leetspeak uses an alternative alphabet of numbers and symbols to replace various letters in words. For example, "leet" becomes "1337" and "Epicodus" might become "3p1c0duz".

    The letter "e" should be replaced with "3".
    The letter "o" should be replaced with "0".
    The capital letter (not the lower case), "I", should be replaced with "1".
    All instances of "s" should be replaced with "z" UNLESS it is the first letter of the word.

Example:

In: "Don't you love these 'String' exercises? I do!"
Out: "D0n't y0u l0v3 th3z3 'Str1ng' 3x3rciz3z? 1 d0!"
