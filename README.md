## Description

Recreate a Ping-Pong application using BDD and Gradle Test . It should have a method that accepts a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:

    Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
    Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
    Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "pingpong"

The method should return an ArrayList (i.e app.pingPong(7) returns [1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong", "ping", 7]).
